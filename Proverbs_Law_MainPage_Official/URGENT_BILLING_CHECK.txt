Deployment Halted: Billing Issue Persists

Despite your confirmation, the deployment has failed again with the identical billing error: "Billing account for project '489808237150' is not found."

This means that billing is still NOT enabled or correctly configured for your Google Cloud project (`proverbs-law-app-2aaa711a`), or the changes have not yet propagated.

**I cannot proceed with deploying your application until this issue is resolved.**

Please:
1.  **DOUBLE-CHECK Your Billing Status:** Go to the Google Cloud Console's billing section: [https://console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2.  **Verify:** Ensure that a billing account is active, linked to your project `proverbs-law-app-2aaa711a`, and that there are no issues with the billing account itself.

Once billing is definitively active and linked, you can try the deployment command again yourself:

`gcloud run deploy proverbs-law-mainpage --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated`

I have exhausted all means to assist with this specific problem. I am unable to perform any further actions on this deployment request.
