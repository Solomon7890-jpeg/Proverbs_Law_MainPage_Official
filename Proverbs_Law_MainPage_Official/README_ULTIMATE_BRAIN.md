## 🔑 API Key Setup

### For HuggingFace Spaces:
1. Go to Space Settings → Repository Secrets
2. Add these secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI key
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google key
   - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Your Perplexity key
   - `NINJAAI_API_KEY` - Your NinjaAI key

### For Local Development:
Create `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-...
NINJAAI_API_KEY=ninja-...
```

**Note:** HuggingFace model works without any API keys!

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Legal Query
```python
# The Brain automatically selects appropriate protocols
query = "Explain the concept of habeas corpus"
# Uses: Chain-of-Thought + Etymology protocols
```

### Example 2: Document Analysis
```python
query = "Validate this contract for completeness"
# Uses: Self-Consistency + Document Validation protocols
```

### Example 3: Legal Research
```python
query = "Research case law about employment contracts"
# Uses: RAG + Tree-of-Thoughts + Legal Research protocols
```

### Example 4: Complex Reasoning
```python
query = "Analyze multi-step legal process for filing a lawsuit"
# Uses: Chain-of-Thought + ReAct + Case Management protocols
```

## 🧠 How the Reasoning Brain Works

### 1. Query Analysis
The Brain analyzes your question for keywords and intent.

### 2. Protocol Selection
Intelligently selects the best reasoning protocols:
- Legal questions → Chain-of-Thought + Legal mode
- Document validation → Self-Consistency + Document mode
- Research queries → RAG + Tree-of-Thoughts
- Multi-step problems → ReAct + Reflexion

### 3. Execution
Protocols run in sequence or parallel, building reasoning chains.

### 4. Synthesis
Results are combined with legal expertise and AI model responses.

### 5. Response
You get an enhanced answer with visible reasoning trace.
